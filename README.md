# ECO Graph Analytics  

## About

A simple repo holding some notebooks related to doing 
graph analytics on the EarthCube CDF Graph.  This 
graph is generated by collecting JSON-LD documents
from the CDF data facilties via Gleaner.

This is just the start of learning what we might 
be able to do with some analytics approaches to this 
graph.

## Try it.

The easiest way to use this notebook is likely to load it into 
Google Colab.

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and then 
use the option to load from a github link.  Use:

```
https://github.com/fils/EarthCubeGraphAnalytics/blob/master/notebooks/ECO_GraphAnalytics.ipynb
```

You should be able to load it, do all the pip installs and inits and 
have the code run.  At this time the NetworkX hits call isn't not working though.  

You can then save a copy to your own Google Drive or locally to continue to 
explore it.   

If do something cool with all this (which I have NOT), please let me know.  I'd
enjoying hearing and learning.
